## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **PHP:** Version 8.1 or higher is recommended.
* **Composer:** For PHP dependency management.
* **Node.js & npm (or Yarn):** For managing front-end dependencies and compiling assets.
* **MySQL (or PostgreSQL, SQLite):** A database server to store your project data.
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.

### Installation

Follow these steps to get your project set up:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-project-folder-name>
    ```
    (Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository and `<your-project-folder-name>` with your project's directory name.)

2.  **Install PHP dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

4.  **Create a copy of your environment file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5.  **Generate an application key:**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6.  **Configure your database:**
    Open the `.env` file and update the database connection details:
    ```dotenv
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name # Change this to your database name
    DB_USERNAME=your_database_user # Change this to your database username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password # Change this to your database password
    ```
    Make sure you've created the specified database (e.g., `your_database_name`) on your database server.

7.  **Run database migrations and seeders:**
    This will create the necessary tables in your database and populate them with initial data (like anime genres and sample anime entries).
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
    ```
    * `migrate:fresh` will drop all existing tables and then re-run all migrations. Use this if you're starting fresh.
    * `--seed` will run all registered seeders after migrations.

8.  **Compile front-end assets:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev # or npm run build for production
    ```
    `npm run dev` will compile assets for development and watch for changes. `npm run build` is for optimized production builds.

9.  **Start the local development server:**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

Now, you should be able to access the application in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or whatever address `php artisan serve` provides).

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

* **Browse Anime:** Navigate through the different anime listed on the homepage or dedicated anime listing pages.
* **View Anime Details:** Click on an anime title or image to see its full description, status, and associated image.
* **Explore Genres:** (If implemented) You might have pages or filters to browse anime by genre.

### Admin/Management Features (If Applicable)

If your project includes an admin panel for managing anime data, you would typically:

1.  **Log in:** Use an admin account (which might be created by seeders or manually).
2.  **Dashboard:** Access a dashboard to add, edit, or delete anime entries and genres.
3.  **Create New Anime:** Use a form to input `title`, `description`, upload `image`, set `status`. The `slug` should be automatically generated.
4.  **Manage Genres:** Add new genres or update existing ones.
